            <h3>Article about teams ranked #1 - should it be deleted? [<a href="#">edit</a>]</h3>
            <div class="article-box">
                <p>There is a Wikipedia article titled Most weeks ranked number 1 (NCAA football). It is, in my opinion, an article that should either be merged into the AP Poll article or simply deleted. The current text of the article is: This is a list of college football teams by the number of weeks they have been ranked number 1 in the AP Polls. Updated 09-22-2013. This is followed by a 3-column list (Number, School, Weeks) of the 11 teams that have been ranked at #1 most often in the AP Poll. That, plus a list of references (most of which are other Wikipedia pages), constitute the entire article. [<a href="#">Shawn</a>] <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs">Reply</button></p>

                    <p>This article is an orphan, and while it is being updated, it hasn't had any substantial text added to the body of the article since it was created, other than the list itself. Can some other folks visit the page and let me know if there's anything I'm missing? Because as I see it, this information doesn't need a separate article to exist.

                    <p>I added some "citation needed" and unsupported attribution clean-up tags to the lead of the list Most weeks ranked number 1 (NCAA football). They were then inappropriately reverted by an anonymous IP citing vandalism. Please keep your eye on or discuss on the article's talk page, where I also started a discussion about the Coaches' poll or renaming the article to fix its sole reliance on the AP poll. The football team navbox format has begun to spread to other sports, college basketball, although no discussions where had pertaining to those sports before mass edits were implemented. This time, I hope to get a real consensus on a format, with a lot of input, not just the usual handful of editors that normally participate...[<a href="#">Danny</a>] <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Read more</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs">Reply</button></p>
